# pitchAnalyzer
A program that utilizes NLTK, Pandas, and the OpenAI API to provide feedback to a user's elevator pitch. 

July 16: Created basic functions that cleaned and tokenized data, calculated the TTR for lexical richness, returned the overused words, run sentiment analysis using the Roberta Pretrained Model, and extracted basic skills using POS tagging. 

In the future, I plan to compare skills with csv files containing adjectives and recruiting skills to more accurately extract these skills using Pandas. Furthermore, based on the TTR, overused words, and sentiment analysis, I will connect this data with the OpenAI API to provide users with feedback and suggestions for their pitch.
